# Layered Architecture - <Badge text="WIP" variant="caution" />

Layered architecture is a design pattern that organizes code into well-defined layers, each with a specific responsibility.

## Main Layers

1. **Presentation (UI)**
   - React components
   - UI hooks
   - Styles and layouts

2. **Business Logic**
   - Use cases
   - Business rules
   - Data transformation

3. **Data**
   - API services
   - Repositories
   - State management

## Directory Structure

```
src/
├── app/                 # App shell (router, providers)
├── features/           # Feature-specific logic
│   ├── cart/          # Shopping cart
│   └── product/       # Product catalog
├── entities/          # Entities and services
│   └── product/       # Product service
└── shared/            # Shared components and utilities
```

## Example: Mini Commerce

In the following sections, we will implement a practical example of an online store using layered architecture.
