# Frontend Architecture Overview - <Badge text="WIP" variant="caution" />


This section covers different architectural approaches and patterns for building scalable, maintainable frontend applications.

## Architectural Patterns

### [Layered Architecture](/guides/architecture/layered/)
Organize your code into well-defined layers with clear separation of concerns. Each layer has a specific responsibility, making your application easier to understand, test, and maintain.

**Best for:** Medium to large applications that need clear separation between UI, business logic, and data access.

### [Clean Architecture](/guides/architecture/clean/)
Build applications with dependency inversion, where business rules are independent of frameworks, databases, and external agencies. The most flexible and testable architecture pattern.

**Best for:** Complex applications that need to be framework-agnostic and highly testable.

{/* ### [Feature-Based Architecture](/guides/architecture/feature-based/)
Organize code by features rather than technical concerns. Each feature contains all the components, services, and utilities it needs to function.

**Best for:** Large applications with distinct, independent features that can be developed and maintained separately. */}

## Choosing the Right Architecture

When selecting an architecture pattern, consider these factors:

- **Team Size:** Larger teams benefit from clear boundaries and separation of concerns
- **Application Complexity:** More complex applications need more structured approaches
- **Scalability Requirements:** Consider future growth and maintenance needs
- **Development Speed:** Some patterns require more upfront planning but pay off in the long run
- **Team Experience:** Choose patterns your team can understand and maintain

## Common Principles

Regardless of the specific pattern you choose, these principles apply to all good frontend architecture:

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each module should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Dependency Inversion:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- **Single Responsibility:** Each class or function should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle:** Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Testability:** Architecture should make testing easy and comprehensive
