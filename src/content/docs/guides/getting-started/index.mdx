## Why do we need architecture?

Frontend architecture is crucial for building applications that are:

- 🏗️ **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and modify
- 📈 **Scalable**: Capable of growing without becoming chaotic
- 🚀 **Efficient**: With good performance and user experience
- 👥 **Collaborative**: Easy to work on as a team
